## Description

One of the reasons I built this project is because I wanted to share cooking recipes with my friends. I thought it is difficult to think and recreate home cooking by myself and needed a recipe, so I wanted a blog that we could easily share.

The other reason is that I wanted to make a note of my original recipe. Currently, I use the iphone note app to write down recipes, but as the number of notes increases, it becomes more difficult to search for recipes I made in the past. I thought it would be convenient if there were category search, keyword search, card display, etc.

It will also help people who need to think up a menu everyday for their family or themselves.

I learned how to configure a relation schema, how to create an authentication function, how to create a search function, and how to upload images to a database.
I gained the knowledge that it can be used for SNS applications in the future.
